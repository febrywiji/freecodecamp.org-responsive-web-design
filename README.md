This repo was created with the intention of documenting the things I have learned on freecodecamp.org, a website that teaches us about programming for free. And the part that I studied at freecodecamp.org was "Responsive Web Design", in this training we are invited to learn the basics or fundamentals of a website where we will learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
